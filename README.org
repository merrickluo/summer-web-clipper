* Intro
Summer Web Clipper is a web extension that can generate a summary of the content on the web page you're currently browsing by leveraging the power of LLM. The summary provides a quick and accurate overview of the key points, making it easier to absorb the main ideas of the content. The extension also enables you to export the summary to the note-taking apps you like, (currently support org-mode export, more to come).

The extension is particularly useful for those who need to read and process a lot of information quickly, such as students, researchers, or professionals. With our browser extension, you can streamline your research process, save time, and retain information more efficiently.

* Real Intro
** Web Clipper
Although I've always desired a universal and customizable web clipper that supports org-mode, I've never been able to find one. As a result, I've decided to create my own.

** Summary Generation
Most long blog or articles on the internet don't have a summary, which can make it overwhelming to read. With the summary generated by AI, you can decide if you need to invest more time in reading the entire article. As you can see in the "Intro", AI (or just ChatGPT) is quite capable of generating summaries. Clipping the page with the summary will help you remember why you wanted to clip it the next time you review your notes.
